## The Open Source Music Approach

The idea of Open Source Music is to just open up the whole process of making and releasing music,
having a website, and playing shows, so that it is something that everyone can participate in. 
We believe that being connected to people on the internet is beautiful and a fine replacement for
the price-gouging, payola-driven, consumerist way that music was released in the past. 

By justloosening the grip a little on certain "intellectual rights," and by actively creating avenues
for participation, we hope that we end up being a really fun band to be into.

## In practice

Okay, so what does that mean, and how is it actually different?

Well, you are allowed to do all of the following:

- Remix or samples our songs all you want, release the results, and even charge people for your work,
  without ever paying us anything.
- Feel free to use the multitrack information that we take care to include with every release, or
  download the literal multitrack masters (in Steinberg Cubase format), which should make
  sampling and remixing much easier
- Let us know about what you made, and [we'll sell it on our site for you, forwarding you the money](#submit-stuff).
  Or just sell it on your site and don't worry about getting it on our site, and keep all the money.
- Edit our site to include your ideas, contributions, merch, recordings, pictures, remixes, whatever.
  It's on GitHub at https://github.com/thesungods/thesungods.github.io/
- Record our shows and sell the recordings on our site
- As you would with an open-source programming project, check out how it was made by listening to the
  multitracks, or watching the video we took of the recording process for each song.
  
## Are there any restrictions on what I can do with your music?

Only two. 

1. YouTube et al monetization might be problematic. We *have to* register our music with Rumblefish,
   a service which monitors sites like YouTube for uploads that have our music in them. That's because
   if we didn't, then when *you* uploaded your remix or derivative work, *our* uploads could be blocked
   in certain countries, blocked for monetization, or even taken down altogether. It just takes one person
   trying to monetize their stuff using a service like Rumblefish for this to happen.
   
   Please, hear us now: We will never ever file a copyright claim against you for uploading a remix or
   sample of our stuff, ever. The worst case scenario we're talking about here is that Rumblefish
   may detect a match and take over the monetization for your upload. We are so sorry
   if this ever impacts you; it's not our intention. But in this world of automated takedowns, we have
   to do this one thing to keep our uploads live. The best defense against all this is creating work
   that doesn't sound like our originals -- which we hope happens, anyway! Then, we hope, you can 
   monetize away.
2. We reserve sync licensing rights. Synchronization licenses are granted to people who make visual
   works such as movies, TV shows, and games, and synchronize your music with the events onscreen. They
   are granted by artist permission only, and we want to keep it that way. If you have an offer for
   selling a sync license for a remix / sample of our stuff that you made, let us know and we'll work
   something out.
