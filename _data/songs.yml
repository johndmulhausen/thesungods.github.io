  title: "Someone to Lose You"
  year: 2015
  lyrics: "love, ephemera<br/>
all it could ever be<br/>
oblivion that you don't want to see<br/>
tell me one time all that i'm going to do<br/>
if i tell myself i'll never be parted from you<br/>
<br/>
well it's the 21st century<br/>
i think i'd better stop telling myself<br/>
together is never gonna stop<br/>
<br/>
maybe i'll leave you, or maybe you'll leave me<br/>
or part with a kiss before succumbing<br/>
glad that you're here<br/>
maybe you can help me see how to make my peace<br/>
with all that i will never be"

  title: "(If I Can Learn) To Love Myself"
  lyrics: "leaving on time, wake and then rise<br/>
never worried that i'm putting you through hell<br/>
all of this and more i'll do<br/>
if i can learn to love myself<br/>
<br/>
be a good girl, you are my world<br/>
doubts have been furled and put up on the shelf<br/>
there'll be time for me and you<br/>
if i can learn to love myself<br/>"
