-- Kurt Cobain, from the liner notes to the great *Incesticide*.

I couldn't put it any better myself, except to add many attributes that weren't
explicitly mentioned. Operate from a place of empathy or leave us alone.
Discussions that we can moderate will be moderated according to these values.
We want our community to be safe and inclusive and fun for **everybody**, and
the only thing that makes that impossible is participation from people who
antagonize others.
